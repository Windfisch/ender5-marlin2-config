# ender5-marlin2-config
My Creality Ender 5 + BLTouch / 3DTouch configuration for Marlin 2, based on Marlin's default config for that printer.

This config is for the Melzi 8bit board.

Look through the commit history for the individual changes.

I had to disable SDCard support due to space constraints; I am using octoprint anyway.
